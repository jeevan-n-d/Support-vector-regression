# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

This repository contains a complete implementation of **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** using Python, with data preprocessing, scaling, training, prediction, and visualization.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Included

- Loading and preparing the dataset
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Training an SVR model with RBF kernel
- Predicting a new result
- Visualizing the SVR results

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `svr_model.py` or `svr_notebook.ipynb`: Main implementation of the SVR model
- `Position_Salaries.csv`: Sample dataset (if applicable)
- `README.md`: Project overview

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Support-vector-regression.git
